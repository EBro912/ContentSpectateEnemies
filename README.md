# ContentSpectateEnemies
 Allows you to spectate enemies in Content Warning.

 ## Usage
 When dead, pressing the E key will swap between spectating players and spectating enemies. When spectating either side, you can press A and D to move to the next player or enemy as normal. The mod will also remember your last spectated enemy.

 ## Installation
 Requires the latest version of [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). After BepInEx has been installed, drag `ContentSpectateEnemies.dll` into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder in the game's root directory.
